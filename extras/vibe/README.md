This folder is a small set of Windows-focused quality-of-life tweaks for
[WezTerm](../../README.md), implemented entirely via WezTerm's Lua configuration API.

No upstream source code changes are required for these behaviors.

## What This Adds

- Minimal UI:
  - Tab bar disabled (`enable_tab_bar = false`)
  - Default shell is PowerShell 7 (`pwsh.exe`) for proper per-user history
- Smart paste on `Ctrl+V`:
  - If the Windows clipboard contains an image: forward `Ctrl+V` into the running
    program (for image-aware TUIs, eg: Codex).
  - Otherwise: paste text normally from the clipboard.
- Paste undo:
  - After you paste, press `Ctrl+Z` (within ~30 seconds) to quickly wipe the paste
    without holding Backspace.
  - Redo is best-effort via `Ctrl+Shift+Z` when possible.
- Theme cycling:
  - `Ctrl+Alt+T` cycles through a curated set of built-in "hacker-ish" themes and
    forces a pure black background.
- Font cycling:
  - `Ctrl+Alt+F` cycles through a curated set of hacker fonts (installed fonts first).
  - The list is intentionally limited to fonts already present on this Windows setup
    plus other freely-available fonts (no paid fonts in the rotation).
- Persistence:
  - The last selected theme/font are saved to a small state file so they survive
    restarts and crashes: `%USERPROFILE%\\.wezterm-vibe-state.json`.
  - Delete that file to reset back to defaults.

## Install

Copy `extras/vibe/wezterm.lua` to your home config path:

- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.wezterm.lua`

Then reload WezTerm (`Ctrl+R`) or restart it.

## Notes

- These behaviors are Windows-specific because the clipboard detection uses
  `powershell.exe Get-Clipboard`.
- The paste undo is a pragmatic "clear the paste quickly" feature, not a full
  editor-grade undo stack.
